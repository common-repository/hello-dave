Based on Matt Mullenweg's "Hello, Dolly." Instead of the lyrics from Louis Armstrong's Hello, Dolly you get HAL 9000 quotes.

== Description ==

As a first plugin I took an existing one and modified it. The Hello Dolly plugin was the perfect place to start. All of the lyrics have been replaced with EVERY quote from the HAL: 9000 from 2001: A Space Odyssey. While wandering the admin pages of your wordpress installation you will be accompanied by these sometimes creepy phrases. Most of the time they don't make sense out of context but it's still a laugh if you're familiar with the movie. And if your not, you're are missing out on a classic.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `hello_dave.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

-What does this plugin do?
Nothing important, that's for sure. You just get these little quotes at the top of every admin page. It's not visible to the public anywhere on your site. It's for your own pleasure.
